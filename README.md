# CTF writeups

**Just as a note:** not all of the solution are completely self made, from time to time I have used other people's writeups as a guide or for tips. I try to include as many references as I can, but because I am a serious beginner to CTFs and the only aim of this repo is for me to work through the given challenges and writing them down helps learning a lot, then I don't feel a need to refer to all of them.

If I ever do write any writeups with the distinct goal of publishing then I will most definitely either make them myself or refer to the used sources.

So **tldr;** aim of the repo is to learn.

# And most importantly: **NEVER use any of the tools or techniques mentioned to _crack/hack/sniff/penetrate/etc_ any _data/networks/computers/etc_ that you do not own or have permission to work with**
