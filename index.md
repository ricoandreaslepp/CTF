Definitely the easiest CTF I've done so far, but nonetheless tons of fun. I've included writeups for 2 challenges that I immensely struggled with during the competition and eventually still didn't manage to solve. After the CTF I rested my head a little and got some new ideas by looking at little parts of provided writeups and then tried again.

Though it shouldn't have been the hardest CTF, it really took a huge hit on me and I only managed to solve 3 challenges for a sad total of 120 points. After the initial shock though I was able to solve quite a few more and made some writeups for them aswell.
